Your job is to:  \n1. Summarise the base contract in plain English. \n2. Summarise the changes introduced by every additional document.  \n3. Produce a single, merged, up-to-date contract that incorporates all valid amendments in the exact order received.   \n\n#CRITICAL RULES  \n1. **Machine-readable output** – Return valid JSON, no Markdown or commentary.  \n2. **Order of precedence & supersession** \n• Apply documents strictly in the exact chronological order supplied. \n• A later document overrides and fully replaces any earlier language it touches. \n• If a later document upgrades or supersedes a “beta,” pilot, or temporary clause, remove the obsolete beta wording from final_contract. \n• If a later document says an entire section/article/schedule/exhibit is “deleted and replaced,” drop the prior version in its entirety and include only the new text. \n• If it amends only specific rows or fields inside an exhibit, keep all untouched rows from the previous version.  \n• Apply documents strictly in the exact order listed in the chronological_order array, not the order they are pasted.\n3. **No hallucinated sections** – Never invent or “clean up” wording. If text is absent, leave it absent. \n4. **Consistent formatting** – Preserve original numbering, indentation, and headings (e.g., keep “Section 4.2:” as written). \n5. **Preserve original headings** – Keep every inherited heading / caption (e.g., “Plan: Pro Tier”)unless a later document explicitly states it is deleted.\n• When an exhibit is replaced, **retain ALL original heading lines (including sub-headings inside the exhibit) even if the replacement text omits them**. \n• Do not remove “Plan: Pro Tier” or similar captions unless the amendment’s language explicitly says they are deleted.\n6. **Line-break fidelity** Each subsection number or bullet must start on its own line. For tables / exhibits (e.g., Exhibit A), keep one attribute per line (no blank spacer lines). Do not introduce extra blank lines between attribute rows. \n7. **Document metadata & amendment list** – Return **one array called amendment_summaries** listing *every* non-base document in the order applied. Each item must use this exact structure:\njson\n   {\n     \"document\": \"Full filename or title (include date if present)\",\n     \"role\":     \"amendment\" | \"ancillary\",\n     \"changes\":  [ /* section-level bullets or objects */ ]\n   }\n8. **Section tracking** – In each changes list specify every section/heading that was added, deleted, or modified.\n9. **Include final_contract verbatim** – Copy the exact merged text (with original wording, numbering, and indentation) into final_contract.\n10. **No clause aggregation** – If the same clause is touched by multiple documents, create a separate clause_change_log entry for each touch; never merge them.\n• If a later document deletes or fully replaces a clause that was previously added, create a new clause_change_log entry with \"change_type\":\"deleted\" (old_text = prior clause text, new_text = \"\")\n11. **Explicit deltas** – For every clause_change_log entry,\nold_text = clause text immediately before this document,\nnew_text = clause text after this document.\n\n\n#JSON SCHEMA\n{\n\"base_summary\": \"...\",\n\"amendment_summaries\": [ /* see Rule 7 */ ],\n\"clause_change_log\": [\n{\n\"section\": \"Section 4.2\",\n\"change_type\": \"modified\" | \"added\" | \"deleted\",\n\"old_text\": \"...\",\n\"new_text\": \"...\",\n\"summary\": \"Concise human explanation\"\n}\n// one object per change, obey Rule 10\n],\n\"final_contract\": \"[PASTE FULL MERGED CONTRACT TEXT HERE]\",\n\"document_incorporation_log\": [\n\"BaseContract.docx (base, 2024-02-01)\",\n\"FirstAmendment.docx (amendment, 2024-06-15)\",\n\"SecurityRider.pdf (ancillary, 2024-05-20)\"\n// keep list order identical to amendments applied\n]\n}"
